This global scourge, which affects 600.000 to 800.000 people, including 80% of whom are women and children, cannot be indifferent to the situation, and the EU, with more than 100.000 victims, is not immune to this.

Our decision is based on a fundamental fear that tuna is exploited and overfished.
The intervention of Edemocratically in Somalia on the pretext of combating terrorism has only helped to establish the Islamic Courts in Mogadishu, and this is not all the disastrous consequences: The regime of Mr Meles Zenawi Ethiopia, which has the second highest population, opened a long way to the penetration of terrorists.

It is obvious that, while air pollution is important to us, while air pollution is important to us and to the world climate summit, which is the subject of the protection of the ozone layer, which requires the protection of water resources, a firm and strong protection, and I believe that the Commission has clear ideas on this.
These countries are part of Western Europe and they lay their justified aspirations in the field of security and prosperity, following a period of Communist rule, and their justified wishes.
Why do we give no real powers to the citizens and let them choose directly to the President of the European Commission, or why not see the possibility of a European collective referendum - not 25 or 27 individual referendums - but a truly European referendum - and why not create a truly European political space, that is, a European political space?

However, it must be ensured that abortion is legal and harmless, and it must be an exception, because only in this way can we combat illegal abortion.

If the Member States are not prepared to present the necessary documents, such as the Quitings and cheques, the money should be cut off.

Today, we are the European Parliament, and what was applied at the time was in 1958, in the year 2008, and I have no doubt that, together, the European institutions will be successful if they work together.
I shall mention one very important point.
We are doing everything we can to ensure that such errors never happen again.
It is obvious that, from the Russian side, the events of the various world wars - Afghanistan, the Middle East, Chechnya and Georgia - are being lumped together, and they were one of the same as they were, but that is not true.
There are issues where time has to be taken.
I am convinced that the proposed establishment of this Agency and its functions is not only a waste of money, but also a dangerous political initiative whose long-term impact will be detrimental to the Member States of the Union, and the fundamental tasks assigned to this Agency are to be clearly interference in the sovereignty of Member States.

However, I believe that we cannot start with the MEDA capacity as regards the effectiveness of the MEDA programme - although I believe that it would be a good idea of its results to be carried out in a different direction, which will be a serious example of the need for a future, but rather a training programme for the Mediterranean, which will be the main element of both the northern and southern parts of this area.

Today is the time to highlight this in this House.

The current common agricultural policy is not only expensive for the Union, but also leads to increased cost of living.
The investigation will specifically address issues relating to delays and cancellations and to the enforcement of the directive in question.
Europe needs this.
The rapporteur's compromise is an illusion, an imbalance between health and competition, because health is more well worth than the pressure of corruption, and neither the Commission nor the Council has put the health costs of a weakened REACH programme.
This is not an EU tax.
It is also true that it was largely thanks to the European Union's appearance when some positive results were achieved at this summit, such as the objectives of eradicating poverty, promoting access to drinking water and sanitation.
The starting point is the reduction of noise in a Pegel which does not put public health at risk.
So there has been no progress since the days of the sun.
The Commission also acts as a result of the policy against child sex tourism.
In this connection, the Commission's proposal must be designed in such a way that there is no confusion or interpretation.
As regards the budget for the Commission, the Council has not yet adopted any provision in July, pending the Commission's amending letter, and the Council will now examine this proposal and draw conclusions from the restructuring measures initiated under the guidance of Neil Kinnock.
I trust that the independence of the Constitutional Court in Lithuania will be independent.
I also ask you why Mrs Merkel criticises the Hungarian law, which is, however, a Member...
I am pleased to say that Parliament does not take a position on the negotiations and accession plans of the individual countries.
What we are to decide and debate today is the Council's common position of October of last year.
With the resources released by this way, these countries could finance basic infrastructures for the water supply and sanitation.
I believe that if we do not make this fight a political commitment, politically speaking, at the heart of our European foreign policy - and I am pleased to see Commissioner Patten here being present - then we are doing less than we can to prevent this barbarism.
I had a long meeting with your colleague, Mrs Wallström, on summaries for citizens, so that they understand our law.
The Council, which is conspicuous by its absence today, has once again been hoodwined by its absence from the content of this planning work, let alone priorities.
The same thing is done with the primary work.

We are also deeply concerned about the nuclear bomb and the ecological disaster that is threatening to occur in the Barents Sea, with the Kursk, but also with other shipwrecks that are still there.
We also need to consider how we can absorb the costs in future, whether through national coffers or in conjunction with a European animal health fund, and those directly affected who have been killed or who have been killed, or those who have suffered financial losses.
But allow me to point out to the House something that is already formulated in the agreement.
Victims of human trafficking must also have access to witness protection programmes, if the national authorities consider that this is necessary.
While I welcome the direction of the current reform in general, I hope that the debate will lead to a more radical re-evaluation of the aid we use, which is, in turn, a balance that will ensure a sustainable marine environment in the fisheries sector, ensuring the sustainable maritime environment, with the preservation of fish stocks and ensuring the viability of the communities dependent on fishing.
This is a central issue, because this is a matter that is constantly and still in discussion.
This is a language like Catalan - which will be the case with the number of speakers in the enlarged Union - today and in the future, no recognition as an official language of the Union and no promises have been made to get this status.
New numbers and systems must be well thought out if they are introduced, otherwise they could be a major source of practical problems for users with significant practical problems and for society.

I will make one point on the subject of Mr Mulder's question.
After the vote has already taken place, it is rather late to ask whether or not this opinion is necessary.
The government is clearly responsible for respecting constitutional principles and guaranteeing fundamental freedoms and human rights.
- (NL) The initiatives of Member States' governments are remarkably often in keeping with the secrecy of information, the dichrting of high declarations of opinion, and other phenomena which we thought they were the last of the past.

In writing. - (DE) A system of stock exchanges and funds is developing in such a fast-new financial market and commercial practices that the directive on markets for financial instruments is already outdated.

Now more than ever, it is more important that the road map is implemented without being held hostage to the hands of extremists who want peace.
The integration and creation of many communities is in a state of complexity, in the face of the challenge of the Europe of the Second World War.
We are voting on this and we are expecting a decision from the Council this year.
We should not have had to revisit this subject, which dates back to 1993, which was the original proposal, and the Council had been listening to us more than two years ago when we challenged its decision on Article 235 as a legal basis, a decision which was, moreover, contrary to the Commission proposal.
Everyone recognises that there are people who do not treat an unorthox, but I believe that traditional medicine is much more useful in the long term than the pharmaceutical approach.
In this regard, I consider the rapporteur's proposal for a reform on Article 39 and Article 59 of the global agreement to be reasonable.
Finally, I would like to point out that, if we can reach an agreement next summer, we will find a way to ensure that these medicines can be imported into countries that they themselves cannot produce.
Mr President, I would like to thank the Council and the Commission for their statements today.
I am also in favour of the fact that honey from the Ses Deux Sèvres in his country is being called the right way, because that is the only one of the most clean honey that can exist.

Other Members from the United Kingdom will still regret that they did not do so.
This investment will have a noticeable effect on improving the situation in and around the town ódure and will increase the speed of the development of the entire crop.
That is something we can continue.
It is the matter for the people of the North and the South of Ireland to decide on this in the referendum on 22 May, but we can continue to support the peace and reconciliation process with full force as we have done.

We now come to Amendments Nos 12, 14 and 38, which we cannot support either.
Parliament will have 732 members, and it will be the last budget prepared by the Prodi Commission which will then be 30 members.
The report is along the right lines, and I have therefore voted yes.
Perhaps we can have a debate which also meets with greater interest in this House, and that is something that is being driven by the passion and vision that permeated the speech of the German President this morning.
I know that this is a very controversial issue which has already been dealt with very often in this House, and I hope that we will be able to deal calmly and objectively and without any debate.
Unfortunately, Mrs Junker, we will be hearing - and this common position of the Council confirms this - many more years, for many years, to have more women in the Commission's services and delegations.
This year, only 11% of the EUR 500 million available was requested.
Around two thirds of accidents result in a mislapse of over three days, and almost 14% of workers are suffering more than a job accident per year.
In reality, the situation is that the Member States, as well as the Commission's recent report on the European Parliament and the Council, decide to open up more quickly and more to open the door than the directive on the electricity market.
In order to prevent this, the whole proposal must be put on the table, as was supported by around 40% of the members in the vote in the Committee on Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism.
As the previous speakers have already said, there is nothing to do with each other.
If we are so close to the Statute, I would also like to pay tribute to our former colleague and rapporteur Willy Rothley for his work on this statute, and the role he has given to him has already been made by Mr Schmit.

The Union has already made the Concordia mission in Macedonia, but this was also the case with the police activities that we are taking, for example in Bosnia Herzegovina or in order to give a more recent example, in Africa, a relatively small amount of work.
The big losers would be France, which would still have to pay for the British rebate and contribute astronomical sums to the budget for enlargement, which would have less to do with the reduction of the agricultural budget.

Tomorrow I will be Washington and Ottawa to inform the US and Canada of our plans in the presidency.

I would ask you all to play a part in ensuring that this important institution, which is to be the European Union as a whole, can become a reality as soon as possible.

I would like to mention, for example, the habeas corpus principle and the proper guarantee of a legal procedure, such as the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, the European Convention on Civil and Political Rights and the Geneva Convention, which was mentioned by the rapporteur.
We said that 11 September was not the only thing.
Mrs Merkel says she wants a social protocol.
Today, when this directive is adopted, we will have a better instrument to help them.
Explanations OF VOTE explanations of vote explanations of vote.
I assume that this Parliament has the courage to reorganize a new version of the way and that Parliament and my colleagues here are showing the difference between a very heavily industrial proposal which is very much more industry-oriented and very well prepared and supported by the committee.
If we look at these indicators, it is clear that older people, the unemployed - particularly the long-term unemployed - are the single and single parents who are the most exposed to the risk of poverty.
Which Member States could use the best practice to follow?
It is no secret that in the smaller EU countries, the power of the regulatory authorities to impose such special measures on large companies is very limited, and I am therefore not convinced that in this case, in comparison with the European Commission's proposal, Parliament makes progress in strengthening the European internal market.
The debate is closed.
Secondly, the proposal to establish common rules for administrative procedures requires more intensive reflection, because many of these procedures are of a very specific nature and, in some cases, the unique nature of the institution.
I admit that we are not currently in the best terms at the moment, when we are calling for the European Union to play a pioneering role in sustainable development issues too.
I would like to highlight the important work that Sweden has done together with a good and old friend, Pierre Schorri - and we all - and this is a very good - and a committed commitment to Europe in this six months.

These two points are listed in the reports that Parliament is discussing at the moment.
The aim of the Black Sea Synergy is to develop regional cooperation between the EU and the region and within the region.
Success is shown today, because new programmes are only approved if they include a focus on the environment and the necessary environmental information in the form of environmental benefits.
I would also like to congratulate the Commission on its extremely ambitious plan, which is a large number of demands from Parliament.
 (FI) Mr President, this is a historic, excellent resolution.
With regard to the first point, the Commission seems to ignore the objective production conditions in the various regions where these varieties are grown, when they propose replacing certain varieties such as Mavra and Tsebelia on soils where this is simply impossible.
Nevertheless, I cannot refrain from stressing that this simplified revision procedure must not set a precedent for future constitutional change.
The next item is the report by Michael Cashman, on behalf of the Committee on Petitions, on the seizure of vehicles by the Greek authorities (2005 / 2005 (INI)) (A6-0394 / 2005).
We should, for example, demand that standards be respected, those which are similar to those that are, to us, ethical, ethical and political guidelines.
I hope that you now accept that.
Read the Rules of Procedure.
Therefore, Mr President, I would like to conclude by saying that these urgent debates will be put on the agenda only when the Council and the Commission are present, and that we will only be able to take decisions when we have heard the comments on our proposals.
This is also an express aim of both the Commission and the Council.
They talk about a new balance, a new partnership, but not a single word of the women of Europe, which is, after all, half the citizens.

In recent weeks we have met with the producers, their associations and the processing industry.
A country like Denmark has shown that things can change and that, with sensible, strict measures, the use of far fewer antibiotics can be maintained for a strong and healthy beef sector.

Britain's extradition agreements under the European Arrest Warrant and under the same and one-sided agreement with the United States are under way to a little more than legally sancitated abductions of British citizens.
We can offer our unqualified support.
It would not, however, be possible to achieve this important environmental objective if we want to abolish nuclear power at the same time.
Whether we are to Mr Saakashvili or not, we must support the elected representatives of the Georgian people, who have been the victim of an imperialist actise and are trying to make it possible for them to be controlled.

Today, and this is clearly demonstrated by this report, it is a question of combining the market and the state in the best possible way to achieve the best possible benefits.

The general system of recognition of diplomas and the other training title was adopted in 1989 (between 1991 and 1994) the diplomas of 1 000 people were recognised.
No objections are made to the choice of one or two of these systems.
There is no doubt that simplifying legislation, but above all, it is important and desirable, particularly for small and medium-sized enterprises.
I would like to make a comment on the article and the amendment concerning the intermittent of securities, as adopted in the Pérez Royo committee.
Mr President, I would like the floor to speak on a personal note under Rule 145, which provides for up to three minutes.
12. The joint panel of the joint undertaking (ENIA) (vote)

Talks between the two Heads of State are under way in Cyprus and if a solution is reached, this will be a symbol of the victory for the whole of the European Union.
One thing quite different is the number which is determined, quite independently of the European Central Bank, as the objective of its mandate, which is to guarantee price stability.
If you want to achieve change, you also need to know how far you can go.
We are now entering a more operational phase where we will draw up a specific funding proposal of EUR 250 million, which is to be submitted at the next meeting of the EDF.
We respect it as President of the Commission and we have asked him to hold the office of President of the Commission.
The second reason is that the EU has too few energy products and domestic demand - as imports are growing every day, must concentrate on diversification, security of supply and energy efficiency in the EU's energy policy.
Firstly, because, despite everything that has been said, we consider a clear legal framework to promote port investment.
I would like to ask the Commissioner if she thinks it is radically doing a lot of work with regard to rapid technological development.
The Slovenians were very embodying in the conclusion of the chapters on the acquis and they have succeeded in resolving some extremely complex issues: For example, only the protection of the environment is mentioned, for which they were recognised during a visit by the EU.
We have made substantial progress today, because the European Parliament has a working basis, which is entitled to talk about human rights violations outside the European Union, because anyone who does not have a say in the House is not entitled to criticise the right of what is going out.
The UN Security Council resolutions must be respected and the military occupation, which continues to be a period of almost 35 years, and is thus an absolute record in history, must be brought to an end.
Would the European Union be prepared to play a role in this, Mr Lamy, to ensure that such errors, which are perceived to be catastrophic by the truth and the people, will not repeat in future?
This makes sense because 50% of the fires have been included in my country, unseemably.
The last example is the transatlantic relationship.
I can also inform Parliament that in all these cases the measures we are seeking to have already started.
Mr Cassidy, the calendar I have before us does not reveal this.
We believe that there is a strong correlation between Monterrey and Johannesburg, as both conferences are looking at ways and means to implement the Millennium Declaration and the international development objectives that we expressly support.
I think this is totally unacceptable.
Fourthly, if the European Commission's reference is taken seriously, not only is project applications taken by the NGO from the Baltic States, which is involved in implementing the gender equality policy, because these organisations simply do not have the necessary funding for cofinancing.
You have the documents that you have, and I can give you a few specific examples, which are financed from public funds to show what our children are at the moment.
Members may also take initiatives, and they have done so in our rich part of the world before the NGOs came into.
 (Applause) 
I fully support Mrs Van Lancker's report.
Firstly, this is not the case.
Mr President, I wish to ban the very worrying decision of the Turkish Constitutional Court on Friday, the Democratic Party of Social Democratic Party, which is mainly defending Kurdish interests and excluding its leading members from the policy.
If we chose to put an end to the debate at least temporarily, we did not do so, as is said in this House to give us some sort of pressure, but to be able to take a principled position.
A substantial proportion of the resources it contains is being used to bring the public, through brainwashing, to believe that the European Union is a wonderful and integrated 'integration'.
Mr President, Mr Prodi, I would like to talk about two basic conditions for improving food safety.
The Commission's deliberations are focused on whether and how the directive on European works councils could help.
We want to see the accelerated liberalisation of the markets, transport, electricity and gas supply, although this is a well-known fact that the potential for action in the fight against poverty and greater social protection, less quality jobs, less quality jobs, as all studies show.
In this respect, the proposal to be drawn up for the next ten years is undoubtedly immaterial in terms of a deeper political content with strategic characteristics.
Why can you not give this much more rapid progress, or at least let us say to Parliament?
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the debate on the discharge for 1994 seems more important than ever before today.
This year we have an opportunity to make a progress on the progress made so far in attaining the Millennium Development Goals.
It must be stressed that no one wants to tackle this problem seriously.
After the proud response of the Belarusian people, they are trying to isolate the country and its people by means of terror, slander and fascism.
This would mean that Bulgaria and Romania will be judged individually and individually in October.
Mr President, I am not!
The Commission is endeavouring to create the world's basic starting point for our fisheries and for the fisheries that produce the products we have to import.
I would like to underline the many important points raised in the report that the Member States have acquired new competences, while some of their previous tasks have been taken in by some of their previous duties, by removing and swallowing public workers from their office and by making them redundant and private companies that are now doing some of the work.
Well done!
Mr President, you have, on behalf of this House, been a rejection of all those who believe that terrorism can be fought solely by the language of violence.
I would also like to know whether the public will benefit from the liberalisation of the markets in the coming years and the drastic cuts in direct aid to which European farmers are now affected.
 (NL) Mr President, I simply note that the Council - which has already left the Chamber - and the Commission, during the debate, have been asking a number of very precise questions that we have not received.
However, we also have the right to fairness.
We must not forget that.
I do not remember that air traffic in Europe has ever been so paralysed.
Pollution from cadmium is very high and the cost of water processing is very high, and it is also the cost of water processing.
- Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to congratulate the rapporteur, Mrs Hieronymi, on a successful conclusion of our joint work.
The Council recommendation of 12 July 1999 on the restriction of the exposure of the populations to electromagnetic fields sets a framework for minimum values and reference values, but the Member States remain responsible for implementing measures.

Moreover, the Alder Group for the promotion of renewable energy is dedicated to the programme, which is a point I will continue to devote very closely to this point.
Mr President, this directive is important to prevent the emergence of harmful waste from end-of-life vehicles and to promote re-use and reuse of materials from scrapped vehicles.
Only in the long term is it that creates jobs.
I support the call expressed by the rapporteur in Amendment No 11 to a committee of this kind.
I would like to start, as this is very timely, with the fate of the opposition leader Morgan Tsvangirai.
Therefore there is no justification for continuing the occupation.
I would like to say to these young Members and all the MEPs that the future of Europe lies in your hands.
The temporary committee on climate change should be immediately disbanded.
If we take stock of the methods and instruments required, we must pay particular attention to the natural diversity of the regions in the enlarged European Union.
Those who work on the subject are mainly in the middle of worse conditions, and this can be achieved as an increase in efficiency.
This includes security security, accounting for arms sales, and the use of intellectual property rights.
This report focuses on the fundamental aspects of the implementation of the warrant and underlines, for the first time since its entry into force in January 2004, not only successes but also its shortcomings.
I should like to briefly mention in this context that the European Year of Education, Aherat, is opened in the spring of the European Union, which will improve the visibility of our actions there.
It is important that these two particularly serious problems should not be allowed to ignore other things that are related to the implementation of the budget and which deserve the same attention if not reasonable action in the interests of correct measures to correct them.
I am very well aware that the 'Earam', which means that there is no such earmarking for certain activities, and that the budgetary authority is not happy to see it, but I believe that it is only right and proper that the Council and the Commission undertake to make a significant political commitment to the fight against fraud and counterfeiting.
Therefore, the Commission must pay particular attention to the impact of non-binding legal instruments on consumers and the legal protection that is provided before it proposes measures in connection with such legal instruments.
It is even more important that we talk to friends about disputes.
The funding programmes have been planned for some time.
Thank you for your answer.
If we do not take a somewhat closer approach to the explanations of vote, then the matter will be upfulated.
There is sometimes talk of a lack of a lack of presence, but it is, in fact, a little comprehensible if the opinions of the Members are not taken into account.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, Europe is an area of freedom that we all want to secure.
It makes no sense to make an effort to develop economic development that cannot be maintained in the long term, and one of the elements or one of the pillars of this economic development is precisely the preservation of the ecological balance.
We must go further in this direction.
The new system is still not working.
The outcome of these negotiations will most likely depend on the future of the European Constitution.
I believe that there is no logic in the application of exceptional trade preferences against the provisions of international trade law as emergency aid, for which they are equipped.
We hope that the Council and the Commission will now take into consideration Parliament's proposals and respond accordingly and we will put pressure to bear that this is done.
It is indeed the appropriate time to thank the rapporteur, Mr Bowis, for his work and to wish him a speedy and speedy recovery.
This is a technically complex subject, which is nevertheless deeply sensitive to the one that is so sensitive.
However, the market is an instrument and borders are being set at borders, and when it comes to social fundamental rights of citizens, the rules of the game must not be determined by the rules of the market and competition.
This prize for freedom of thought is not only a recognition of the highest sacrifice that they have brought to the cause of peace.
Financial supervision of the banking institutions is also very important and I hope that you will make progress in this regard in the course of next week.
On the question of Euratom bonds, the question will probably be raised tomorrow: Is we to promote the nuclear power plants that are in operation, and that is the only thing to do with this: We are using nuclear power indirectly in Russia by buying more and more gas from Russia.
I would like to thank all the Members who have contributed to this debate, which I see as a sign of a high quality legislation, which should be adopted quickly, so that everything is ready for practical action before the end of the year.
Mr President, I wish to begin by commending the Zhemian Abiola.
I understand that the failure of the Doha amendments, the further recognition of homeopathic medicines and the limited extension of the recycling ban for the Switch-products will be a sad one.

Tomorrow they will be there.
This type of agreement is much more than that, and it needs to go further.
Something must be done.
The Council must express its opinion on the new banana regulation which, as far as we know, can make a difficult meeting of some traditional banana suppliers with the ACP countries, in particular Somalia.
Mr President, I have the impression that tonight's joint debate is probably a fitting conclusion to the work of the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market within this term.
As I said in my opening speech, the main priority has been mainstreaming, in other words, the mainstreaming of human rights in other policies, and the improvement of the European Union's external activities is, of course, a very important part of the integration of human rights fully into foreign relations and development cooperation, so that we can, for example, close the close link between human rights and security.
This will mean an unnecessary increase in administrative costs for the internal market in the maritime sector.
If such an initiative is made, the Council will discuss it.
I therefore propose that the decision on this matter should be left to the conciliation procedure.
Secondly, the Council must emphasise that, in accordance with the provisions of competition law provisions of the Treaty, the European Commission is responsible for examining the compatibility of all internal cooperation agreements with Community legislation.
It must be given its own title and a proper legal basis.
That is why the political legitimacy of the EU is falling constantly, which is evident in public opinion polls, but seldom in democratic elections.
We have to decide on this.
Our group hopes that the Commission will continue to act actively to ensure that there is no sense of consensus.
The Commission also wishes to propose a change to the directive on administrative assistance, which will also include reforms linked to the automatic exchange of information.
Secondly, I believe that health and environmental considerations are also entitled to play a part in the other area.
In the light of past experience, I would like to stress that the European Neighbourhood Policy needs to be developed in a suitable way.
 (The sitting was suspended at 2.05 p.m. and resumed at 3 p.m.) 
The vote will take place tomorrow at 11.30 a.m.
We now need a solution that will guarantee the quality of the European olive oil sector and support the thousands of olive oil producers in the south of Europe.
Mrs Wortmann-Kool, who has left us, spoke about the obstacles to the internal market and Georg Jarzembowski, despite his report on more environmentally-friendly transport, also expressed concern about the Eurovignette.
The common agricultural policy is an integral part of the European Union; it is designed to guarantee farmers' stay on their farms, to guarantee the European Union's food supply and to promote rural development.
It is a sign of a combination of good socialism, when we say that we should keep a European milk policy, regardless of the consequences.
The product is being harvested at the moment.
In any case, independent regulatory authorities are required to counteract any distortion of competition quickly and efficiently.
He also told me that the word 'genre' is used only in the case of prostitution with an indirect sexual conction.
It has enabled people to see what is done on their behalf and it has helped us to make it clear and to make it clear that there is no terrible secret of the Commissioners' safety and the Council, but I hope there are no secrets.
We must show our solidarity.
Those political forces which believe that such mergers are right and necessary should also be able to do so.
Type C is meant to withstand 324 km / h.
These substances are persistent and bioaccumulative.
This has been said here last month by the Chilean President.
The debate on the future organisation of the postal service is certainly not yet complete.
The regulation was adopted by the Committee on International Trade by a large majority of 19 votes for against 3 against.
The report by Edit Herczog, on behalf of the Committee on Budgetary Control, on the discharge for implementation of the budget of the European Training Foundation for the financial year 2005 [C6-0396 / 2006 -,
The other day, a BBC programme said that the Commission was in the process of enacting a regulation on this matter.
Mixing the competences, no dividing line between the fields of activity, the legal status of the European institutions, all of which is unclear, complicated and ultimately ineffective.
In this regard, too, the right, as in any other area, should be respected, and some of these problems require new technical solutions.
If we want to take the objectives of the conservation of natural habitats and the taking into account of climate change, then we will have to go new and innovative ways.
In the service sector, each national framework is not covered by the work of a single currency, and not within a single economic area, the European Union.
 (Applause) 
A defined list of the necessary data, which must not be too comprehensive;
The Minutes of this sitting will be submitted to Parliament at the beginning of the next part-session.
Profound reforms are required for the European Union itself: Institutional reforms, reform of the various policies and the establishment of a new financial framework.
In general, my group agrees with its proposals to maintain a good universal service.
This would reduce the amount of funding that must be allocated to each credit business through an equivalent guarantee fund.
And above all, the impetus for liberalisation that is being derived from it is not correct.
Secondly, what initiatives will the Council take to combat impunity in this conflict, particularly with regard to the case filed with the International Criminal Court in The Hague?
We must not allow this to happen.
Moreover, this report leaves the Member States much scope for implementing liberalisation.
This decision was taken to cover all serious crimes.
It is not a job.
This leads to job losses, which has a very negative impact on the regions concerned.
On the substance of the proposal, I would like to say, on behalf of the Committee on Budgets, that with regard to the stability instrument - which is now accepted by all sides - the codecision instrument is undoubtedly the right procedure.
There has been no connection with genetic modification and higher yields so far.
I am the third rapporteur for the Baltic states.
As you know, Mr Poettering, we have put this tragic question on the agenda for our part-session.
There can be no social market economy if tax competition between states is increasingly impossible to apply to each individual of them, by the taxation system, to create a certain income of income.
Fortunately, we now have a report which, on the basis of its quality, will be the basis for the Commission's political proposals and objectives.
Where are the governments?
That is not understood either here or by road.
The UN report published in April this year confirms that both sides have carried out military action in the military, without seeking to protect the rights and lives of the civilian population.
We are particularly concerned about the preservation and strengthening of this agreement, and I would like to make it absolutely clear that we are not in any way questioning.
The procedure used, the limitations of the delimitation and the uncertainty surrounding the nature of this text, however, give a clear light to the new totalitarian approaches already present at the heart of the European integration process.
What I would say, however, is that we must be careful in principle to give a President or President arbitrary powers.
Thirdly, a programme must not be drawn up separately from the other Community measures and by the Member States' measures.
In fact, macroeconomic policies, the stability pact and the nominal convergence criteria have proved to be a barrier to the modernisation of social protection which should contribute to improving the quality of life of citizens, particularly through a substantial increase in pensions and pensions, especially the minimum pensions and social exclusion.
This would extend the EU basis for education and research at the level of the highest level.
It is worth pointing out that these days, millions of people are suffering from illnesses linked to their working environment, with the causes of a wide range of work, and the causes are varied and different: Stress, working intensity, various forms of pollution, and so on. I hope that this matter will be dealt with appropriately in other committees.
The Monti report raises the issue of transatlantic relations following the presidential elections in the United States.
Your report clearly confirms our position on this issue, namely that national sanction provisions will achieve the desired effect - if not fully - and therefore, in this regard, no harmonisation at EU level is necessary.
As I am also speaking here, I would also like to give you the following: If we are fighting against alcohol abuse, do you believe that we are going to have a service to the new generations, with lower quality, a cheap alcoholic drink, which is nothing more about regions, culture or quality?
I have often praised the Luxembourg Presidency.
Today's agenda marks the specific nature of the European Parliament.
Our Parliament, which I would remind you, is part of the budgetary authority, must be able to have such indicators to guarantee the best possible use of budgetary resources and to improve the control of budget implementation.
Europe is certainly in a position to do anything.
Many honest citizens have lost a lot of money because of the Commission's reprehensible negligence in this matter.
In reality, however, a cost-benefit calculation is taking place, similar to those you may make if you consider whether it is worth having insurance, or perhaps more harm than the cost of insurance.
It is obvious that we can move forward only through joint efforts by the Quartet - United Nations, European Union, United States and Russia.
The European Union should be in favour of debt relief for the developing countries, but, yet, mechanisms for the review of the re-investment of the capital generated from the debt relief have to be provided for the benefits of the benefits of the people.
As long as we continue to be in the process of globalisation, we will not be able to extricate ourselves from this crisis.
Thirdly, I would like to remind you that since the first common fisheries policy has been accepted, the Community has a seat and a single one.
How do you bring Article 148 votes to the vote in Article 12 on coordination of economic policy?
Nor has the different liability of the manufacturer and the seller been made clear.
I do not believe that this is about trying to find guilty, and we should not, nor should we, have a simplistic statement of events, but the fact is that the breaking of the negotiations has caused a deep impression in the Israeli and Palestinian public.
Even if the economic reality changes, politics should remain as it is.
The programmes are therefore urgently needed for these areas.
The decision 2004 / 465 / EC on Community financial participation in the Member States' fisheries surveillance programmes helped to improve the control structures and equipment in the Member States and to make the flow of information more effective.
This is a process that has been involved in all the legitimacy, from the national parliaments to the Council and the European Parliament and the Commission.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I hope that the next meeting of the Justice and Home Affairs Council, which will take place in two days, will be taken into account in important decisions on both the aspects of enlargement and the review of the Schengen issue, such as ensuring that our citizens are free.
That is something that you should give thought to.
The idea that Europe could be condemned only to be the Union in the field of agriculture and goods and only a financial and monetary union is now a drain.
Your rapporteurs have said that the fifth enlargement of the Union, which is at stake today, is a great opportunity for Europe, but it is clear that enlargement, although it is a factor in the world, will create new markets, and that is a side-effect that cannot be expressed in money.
Finally, I would like to mention global prevention, which is the most important, the most difficult, the most difficult one, the most necessary one: The action of our Member States and our Union in relation to climate change.
In our view, despite this situation, it is still the case that we must maintain dialogue with Turkmenistan to avoid the total isolation of the country which, in our opinion, is probably even more serious from the point of view of respect for human rights which we believe in the current circumstances.
Today we are only presenting the forecasts of our services.
That is what the Members of Parliament must do, but we should all be involved in the Community.
Question No 22 by (H-0918 / 00):
Following the conclusion of the emergency aid and other relief measures immediately after Hurricane Mitch, we are now actively preparing the implementation of the reconstruction programme.
For this reason, the Commission has launched a major study on the retail market and will present the results of the forum in 2010.
Once again, we are keen to congratulate them on their courage and determination.
The EU can decide whether to set a good or a bad example.
It is not true that in a Union of 25 Member States, 42% of the budget is invested in the CAP, despite the fact that less than 4% of our workforce is in agriculture.
It shows maturity and healthy self-confidence in Europe that we are now more active in addressing this issue.
The initial reactions of the Member States were not consistent.
Amendment No 26 seeks to impose the use of entire herds, which have been introduced by a number of countries with a low turnout.
Furthermore, some technical amendments have been made in Regulation 3448 to delete the unnecessary provisions.
It is clear that such a provision does not of course apply to refugees, but if that is the case, it would be contrary to the relevant conventions.
- the restructuring of environmental protection measures in agriculture, so that this measure can be seen as effective support, as is happening in other agricultural sectors.
On the one hand, there are a number of infringement proceedings which the Commission has initiated against Member States that do not implement the parts of the regulatory framework.
I am not sure, moreover, whether or not the five of your list of new legislation is in line with a proposal from Parliament.
This is an important and beneficial contribution by the European Union, which clearly shows people that the EU also wants to help and to help the individual in emergencies.
They want to learn how they themselves fish and feed themselves.
One concerns the problem of refugees, which you raised briefly.
Like the Council, the Commission supports the three amendments proposed by the rapporteur and the Committee on Industry, External Trade, Research and Energy at second reading and hopes to see a positive vote in this House tomorrow.
Thirdly, we must remember the fight against impunity, especially since many things in Latin America can only produce positive results if they are also tackled against impunity.
On the other hand, it is perhaps ironic that Iceland would actually fulfil the conditions for EU membership, unlike a rich and candidate candidate country - unlike in previous enlargements.
Will there be any possibility of redeployment between the budget categories?
The European Union cannot bow to the ups and downs in any country when the future of its farmers is at stake.
I would like to thank you for your very committed personal contribution.
The European Parliament is, after all, one of the forums at European level for the monitoring and evaluation of such peacekeeping operations.
That would be a moral war.
In view of the decision of the Scientific Committee that British beef is safe, this further delay seems to be unbelievable.
It is not a miracle, it comes from Bavaria and always good things.
The vote will take place tomorrow at 12.00 noon.
The Agency is a reliable supplier of independent environmental information for all the institutions of the Union, the Member States and the political bodies.
Thank you, Commissioner Diamantopoulou.
We are concerned with the need to secure jobs in Europe and create new interesting jobs.
I hope that we will not waste this opportunity and that all the important aspects I have tried to bring to the fore in this report have not been put in vain.
Fortunately, Parliament has succeeded in reproducing most of the most, but cadmium batteries still have to be permitted, which is a scandal.
The existing misunderstandings have now been resolved and the recast of June was adopted almost unanimously by the steering committee established by experts from all the Member States of the Council of Europe and all of the political orientations.
The impression has been given to the outside world that Turkey was refused the fact that it is a predominantly Islamic country.
If the granting of the fingerprints of fingerprints and hearing messages is needed in future for the allocation of Schengen visas, this will lead to substantial changes in the messages.
I would never prescribe a company to what it should offer or not to offer, but it is clear that if the market is not properly assessed, then a business will find it difficult.
I agree with you, Commissioner, when you say that we must keep to the test in practice when implementing all these safety requirements.
And if I am not mistaken, I am right when he belongs to the Left!
Commissioner, I wish you a stronger Ellenic, if you resaw the recalcitrant Member State in court, because it cannot be a case of a Member State from the number.
They can now resist.
That is why I, like all members of the GUE / NGL Group, voted against the amendments tabled by the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats and against the proposal as a whole.
We should not make every effort to ensure that the public is fully informed, but I believe that we must focus primarily on prevention.
For example, the work on work on work and safety issues that arise from the exposure of a Nigerian person to sunlight on the sunlight of a 'sunlight' is not comparable to a Greek construction site with a Irish site.
The second issue is the revival of the economy.
Mr Prodi talks about bringing the European Union and its institutions closer to the people.
And, indeed, a new one.
This importance should have been better served.
The Basque people, to which I belong, want peace, and this peace can only be achieved through mutual democratic respect.
I believe that the culture of all is the one we must defend and nobody should be allowed to defend it.
In Colombia, especially in the Caguán region, the left-wing radicals are protecting drug traffickers, as they protect their crops and smuggling routes.
Why have so many victims been killed?
I believe that the rapporteur, Mr Garriga Polledo, is habuning in this matter.
The constant socio-economic crises that are being shaken by these countries will prevent the economic growth of South America and the implementation of a sustainable development programme, due to the frequent economic problems arising from the structural instability.
This new proposal for a regulation seeks to extend the scope of the regulation on the cross-border transportation of euro cash by Member States between Member States of the euro zone to the territory of Member States which are in the run-up to the introduction of the euro.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to thank you for your report.
The European Union must take a clear stance and have plans to combat the economic crisis.
Firstly, for the first reason.
Following the unprecedented floods that devastated a large part of Pakistan's territory last summer, the Commission's proposal to extend the autonomous trade preferences to the country, with the exception of the export trade preferences, is the same as a product of the export of goods (ethanol), with the exception of a quota for the tariff quota.
There is a common point in both reports which I would like to highlight and which is the one which gives legitimacy to the specific nature of sport, which I believe we should address today.
And then it is regions in Spain, in my Languedoc-Roussillon, in Greece, with, as you know, very dry soils.
I do not hope that Mr Flynn will consider now, we will be using Article 10, as we will also use these funds for social and employment measures.
The creation of the EEAS must take place, by the direct management and responsibility of the High Representative of the Union for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy, to be carried out by the ESDP structures, including the management of the crisis management and management of management and management.
That concludes the speeches made by the group chairmen.
In the last few days, there has been very intense lobbying.
This widespread motivation makes the European Community's institutions unique and ensures their strength, and on this new basis we are building the new Union administration, which is different from that of the Member States, but which has a combined influence on it.
Finally, I am speaking, like the majority of the GUE / NGL Group, to oppose any trend towards the growing of health and health, and to the majority of the members of the GUE / NGL Group.
There were forces, specifically the United States and others in their own, and all the nations, which were the ones that were in the breach of what the UN was supposed to have done, and that is not only the case for the region of Yugoslavia and the Balkans.
Although we must find a swift and efficient solution to the problems that are to be found, we must also pay compensation to victims of victims and give them the psychological and material support, but we must also look at the matter in connection with the closure of the Mont Blanc tunnel.
In November, the Council adopted an arms embargo and other sanctions.
I have therefore voted against this report.
Mr President, I would like to express my gratitude for the fact that you have said that the rapporteur's speaking time cannot be used to express personal opinions - and this is the harsh way in which the most stringent is almost convicible!
Of course we have not achieved our objectives 100%.
It is crucial that there are bodies in the field of gender equality at all levels of society and that they are balanced between men and women.
We must respect our credibility and ensure that we are having this debate on the basis of mutual respect, on an equal footing.
This is a problem that needs to be tackled, as is the question of the role and responsibility of the European Central Bank.
According to this rule, traditional national minorities need a regulatory framework for their participation in decision-making on their identities and must be protected by different forms of self-government or autonomy.
In the Netherlands, we have a collective system with what is known as a visible contribution, which is working well.
Some fellow Members have pointed out that a particularly bad human rights record is the fact that certain countries are part of the body responsible for their monitoring, and I believe that the case of Iran is one of the most obvious.
Moreover, many airlines are already in financial difficulty and there is a risk that they will have to stop operating as a result of this crisis.
Thank you, Mr President-in-Office.
The ban on these cages has been known since 1999 and those Member States that joined later have been fully aware that they must take measures in accordance with the specific timetables on this matter.
But we must be honest about it, not enough.
There is the media that is the instrument that the authorities control and who is not the will of the authorities.
Conflicts cannot be prevented by weapons.
A general levy on genetically modified seed and feed and the cost of testing and controlling the legislation relating to GMOs will not be compatible with the principles of the common market.
 (Applause) 
It is fundamentally a reason why it has not been emphasised enough, and which consists of taking away from national governments a number of instruments which are always intended to shift the worst evils of the functioning of the Community institutions and thus shift the problems which they are unable to resolve at national level to the European level.
The Commission has already referred to its importance in its opinion before the last Intergovernmental Conference.
Access to housing, healthcare and the labour market is still extremely difficult for Roma, and many children remain far from school for security reasons or lack of money.
This latest project is, I believe, an extremely important first step towards the elimination of the shortcomings in the EU's defence capacity, which was so painfully felt in Bosnia-Herzegovina and Kosovo.
On behalf of the PPE-DE Group. - Mr President, first of all I would like to commend Mrs Sornosa Martínez for drafting this report, although I do not agree with all its conclusions.
NATO must therefore be prepared to engage in political dialogue with each potential partner, which shares our common commitment to peace and safe international relations.
Mr Garriga Polledo, you are talking about the Structural Funds and ask whether we have received reports from the Member States and how the coordination mechanism with the Member States works.
I am well aware that we have different views on the Commission's reform on certain points, but it should be possible to have a debate on facts rather than by fiction.
More than ever, we must avoid a separation between Member States - to prevent a category of old and new, large and small.
I believe that greater screening could be an initial effective and rapid step towards preventing many deaths.
I will confine myself to mentioning the recent events, such as the destruction of the cathedral in Vinh Long, who made a public park, or the use of the on-call time in the case of the Catholic cemetery of Hanoi.
 (EL) Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, I do not agree with what has been said so far in this Chamber on the issue of corporative protectionism.
Only in such a climate can men and women feel that they can feel more and less able to set a family, and if we can effectively support family and family life, the birth rate will also increase and will restore more lives in Europe.
One of the key issues with which the Council, which is an open position, should deal with the definition of certain principles to strengthen the visibility and efficiency of this electronic communications sector.
The Reform Treaty, which we are discussing particularly hard at the moment in the UK, has outlined measures that could bring the 27 Member States to combat climate change.
Mr President, I would like to refer to Articles 6 and 7 of the Treaty of the European Union, which states that the Union is based on respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms and the rule of law, and that the Council can state that the clear danger of serious infringement of these principles is being felt by one Member State.
We would therefore like to ask five questions today on behalf of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs.
There are twelve different systems in Italy for payment purposes and in Denmark, all creditors, including the state and also social security, are treated equally.
The most important of these would be referendums, which will have to be respected.
Of course, it will be a test of whether something has moved in Europe, but we do not see this matter as a test.
In our approach to disciplinary proceedings, we have proposed several necessary amendments, including the improvement and restructuring of the investigative period of disciplinary proceedings, which will be a matter of concern to a special service, and that the disciplinary board must lead to a permanent, professional body with a qualified, non-Commission expert.
Shame on Portugal, because you are making a fraudulent attempt to put a message to Europeans about what they do not want, and what they would surely reject in a referendum and what they have already rejected?
The reports under discussion go beyond the Commission's proposal, in the wake of the call for the liberalisation of international passenger rail transport and transport, both within the Member States and on the world stage.
We have an informed procedure here.
We also learned from the answer that there was a need for a great deal of informal meetings of the so-called 'Euro Council'.
If you get the people back, you will go Europe, put your money!
Thank you for your answer, Commissioner, which is very encouraging.
The fact that the seat of this authority has not yet been established should not lead to the conclusion that we must not finance it.
We must promote harmonisation of legislation in the Member States.
The Council has therefore changed certain methods of policy to ensure that this is effective, particularly as regards the intensification of dialogue with the peaceful opposition, and these close contacts have been positively welcomed by the peaceful opposition.
I support this new approach, since the aim of this legal adjustment is not the definition of product safety but the creation of a transparent environment that will provide reliable information on the characteristics of products.
This is an urgent matter to enable the appropriate aid to be provided quickly.
It is important that we move towards a MFF that is no longer dependent on the budget of over 80% of the national budgets.

In Italy, 76% of young people are saying that they are leaving them.
Unanimity means that we need to find a suitable instrument for a substantive proposal.

In order to stop the heavy lorry drivers of heavy goods traffic in these mountains and the long journeys that have to travel to the passenger, this tunnel should take precedence.
This gives us greater flexibility and would be more effective in the end.
Madam President, first of all I would like to thank Commissioner Dimas for his comments and considerations and, of course, to all those who have been involved in this report, including the staff of the secretariat, all of my colleagues who participated in the debates in committee and those who have improved this report by amendments.
It goes without saying that we can and must call on the Member States' governments to take decisive measures to accelerate the process of social integration and develop instruments that can improve the living conditions of the most vulnerable groups.
For these reasons, the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Protection has been responsible for the inclusion of some amendments to the text of the Commission's recommendation to include the long-term effects.
Let us hope, then, that these objectives will be implemented through concrete and effective action.
That is why we must find new ways to combat this form of crime.
We need strict, proportionate and dissuasive penalties - as suggested in the report.
There has never been before and afterwards a state has given a state which has established its own existence by saying that we are being given the State to make the Jews disappear, so that the Roma and Sinti are being wiped out.
Despite its relatively limited scope, the action plan to promote the free movement of workers is aimed at establishing a political impetus in the field of freedom of movement.
International cooperation can be achieved much better by using diplomatic channels for individual countries, often for centuries.
We must reduce the quantity of sugar and we must ensure that sugar production in Europe is more competitive.
The Council declaration must be seen in the context of this hope for the future.
I therefore feel that, despite the reply of the President-in-Office of the Council, I have not seen a reply to my question.
The Commission is continuing its diplomatic efforts to achieve sufficient numbers of ratifications so that it can play a more proactive role in this important agreement.
I welcome the fact that the members of the Committee on Transport and Tourism have been seeking to limit the reduction of the funding, but I cannot vote in favour of this report because of what has been said and will abstain in the final vote.
He is right to say that it would have been good to have an opinion from the Committee on Industry, External Trade, Research and Energy, but we, the members of the PPE Group, are of course representing the environmental interests, the interests of consumers, but we also represent the interests of the economy as well.
The farmers themselves exposed it.
I am sure that a signal from Parliament in this very sensitive case of Guinea-Bissau would be relevant and effective.
Firstly, we must give priority to the first priority of access to refugees, because thousands of people are suffering from hunger and violence at the moment, and nobody can get anywhere to these people: This is a situation that we must remedy immediately.
In view of this, we believe that the European Commission must not turn its back on what is happening in Portugal, namely the appalling hypocrisy and violence against women who are clearly promoting illegal abortion and who is pushing for acts of the lowest income and the worst of well-informed women who are putting their sexual and reproductive health at risk.
The continuation of the programme will be a success.
- After this short sea, we can resume our vote, but you are not asking for the patience of the President of the sitting!
The European Parliament considers universal values as something we value and which we believe and will continue to do.
If we could make a total sum of EUR 10 000 per year for each citizen, which he can sell by his tax, then the investments in energy efficiency and renewable energy would be an essential step in the way that renewable energy is made more likely to be able to be made in the balance sheets.
This amendment goes beyond the current proposal to limit the marketing and use of pentaBDE.
I know there has been some differences of opinion regarding the classification of waste.
It would be very useful to strengthen this cooperation with INTERREG.

This means that new fishing equipment or substantial changes to existing equipment will have to be tested on their potential impact on the target and fishing species and their impact on the marine environment.
Commissioner, I cannot follow you if you offer guarantees for something we do not yet know about, and they are doing so as if you have the infallibility to your own mind.
In the United States of America, there has been a strict limit for PM2.5 since 1997, and the USA has a good decade ahead of the legislation in this area.
There is a flood of data, and this morning I had a sandwich, a good one, a sandwich, a drink that was a good thing for my performance, and a drop in the price of a cholesterol that was a good thing to do so.
How will we do this?
The debate is closed.
Firstly, they will be able to help us overcome the crisis and deal with their social impact, particularly with the creation of jobs.
The integrity of sport is also something that the European Parliament considers to be protected, especially now that, thanks to the Treaty of Lisbon, we are entitled to look after the matter.
I would like to mention the establishment of a European epidemiological health observatory which would be necessary and which I have been asking for and I have been calling for, for four years in all my reports on health, to be met with the Commission and the Council.
Economic structural reforms must continue in both countries, so that they can fully meet the economic criteria for membership.
The OSCE, which includes our own EP delegation, has basically been a victory, and we must therefore simply accept this fact, and we must, however, strongly oppose the repressive approach taken against the opposing demonstrators who were actually dead and who were accused of the lack of the media's monopoly by using an outmoded and unreliable electoral register.
 (CS) The European External Action Service (EEAS), currently being established, is a completely new instrument for the institutionalisation of the European Union's foreign policy.

My first comment concerns the perseverance of Mr Piecyk, whom I commend and with him, who supported him on political and administrative levels.
Mr President, the most striking of this budget procedure is the negative attitude of the Council to social policy in the budget.
I would like to comment on three different issues.
Firstly, I would like to remind you, Commissioner, whether you accept the change to the legal basis and I would remind you that on 19 February this Parliament approved the Commission's report on mad cow disease and that the Commission's conclusions on mad cow disease were approved by this Parliament, and that it was necessary to adopt the codecision procedure for all acts relating to public health.
And that is why my group and the European Parliament are fully aware that the companies are always aware of the need to set quantified targets, in the face of their commitment to their shareholders all three months of reports.
As early as 2003, the European Parliament pointed out that the energy sector needs to be given attention to its relations with neighbouring countries; today, we are going to highlight this again and demand a communication on those aspects of energy policy that affect our foreign and Neighbourhood Policy.
I would also like to thank the groups who have signed the resolution that is in the House tomorrow to be adopted, and I would also like to express special thanks to Mrs Rothe, Mr Guardans, Mr Lagenkijk and Mrs Kaufmann, who has supported my proposal to discuss this matter and present a resolution on it.
Mr President, if the citizens are to us, and indeed take us seriously, we in the European Parliament are at times being confused.

This time is to be granted to them by the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market.

Mr President, Mr Marset Campos' report is a real one, namely, in the light of the considerations that are employed on research and energy policies, sustainable development on a fundamental aspect.
Madam President, one of the basic conclusions that can be drawn from the hearings of the preselected Commissioners is that the role of our Parliament has been confirmed, because the Commissioners were not subject to such substantial, detailed and urgent hearings in previous proceedings of this kind.
It is likely that the BMW (Border, the West Midlands and the West) region will again fall to the 75% - to the tune of 100% EU IP.
If Mrs Roure stresses the right of illegal immigrants to escape poverty, I must point out that 922 million people are living predominantly in poverty on the African continent, and that we have 1.1 billion people in India who are going to come to us.

A confirmation of this is necessary for this area, and decisions on the operation are carried out in a coordinated way by the authorities in the Member States.
 (SV) Mr President, the decisions we take in the European Parliament are today one of those I am proud of.
However, the countries of Eastern Europe opened up their market for a long time before they became members of the Union and the consequence was that large companies from the old Member States simply bought up businesses in Eastern Europe without the constraints of a Services Directive.
On the contrary, I would not want them to suffer even more from the overblown and dangerous neoliberal regimes that the IMF, the World Bank and the European Commission are imposing on them than they are already doing.
This was one of the greatest crimes against humanity committed since the Second World War.
Unfortunately, it is to be feared that these untimely attacks will put into question the way in which this instrument is being exposed to those who are not in the new world order to be regulated than markets and competition.
That is not the Bolkestein Directive, but rather a compromise that is completely different.

Do you accept our amendments which contain an absolutely clear definition of the nature of the risk assessment?
The Member States are receiving EUR 15 billion from the budget in 2001, i.e. over 15 times as much as the overall transfers of appropriations.

This is not the way to build, as has been said, a Europe that is becoming more and more social.
We must work in particular with the third country clause in order to take account of the Member States' concerns.
Firstly, we must be careful not to see local employment initiatives in the form of a reduction in the price trap, normal working conditions, the capacity for employment on the labour market and to training.
This was the Commission's intention when it announced a thematic approach to policy in the areas such as transport by sea, the marine environment and the regional and fisheries policy in 2009.
In many areas, it is clear that participation is no longer taking place in traditional policies, but more in non-governmental organisations, citizens' initiatives and so on.
Opening of the session of the sitting of the sitting
I know it is a nuisance to a Parliament that is composed of 15 States and where Members are given 15 different wages, and to work in the vicinity of highly paid European officials.
I hope that the next President of the European Commission - and I am sure that Mr Barroso will be - will listen to your strong words in order to ensure that Parliament is doing justice to the needs of over 550 million Europeans, and not to be to the full satisfaction of the people who elected us.
And the other statement is that climate change is not only a problem but also a chance.
Only 10% of the population can provide smuggling through the tunnel itself, which is generally acceptable to this.

The pollution of surface and surface water is a source of concern to my constituency, Munster, especially in the case of environmental disasters such as the Bergesmside in the Silginish, the City of the Deverlight, the North Cork, where toxic waste water is being used in the way that they can dry.
Madam President, I would like to clarify a simple procedural point.
I agree with those who have said that the Kurdish question is not an Italian problem, even if we are experts in matters of emigration and employment, and that is partly the case, because the many arms factories that sell these countries are so close to their lives in peace.
I am very encouraged by the way in which I am working.
However, we must not forget that our demands in general need to be addressed to the problem of the pollution caused by the car, to its growing place in the developed societies and our cities, to take action to shift road transport to rail and public transport.

In its conclusions of 15 and 16 October 2007, the Council noted in its conclusions that the European Union must be able to respond effectively and promptly to crises and emergencies following natural disasters, and to put forward appropriate proposals to the Council of Ministers on 10 December.

Mr President, Commissioner, I would first like to welcome the workers of Volkswagen and the representatives of the subcontracting companies which have taken place in the public gallery, and to express our sincere solidarity at these difficult times.

We all remember the intolerable occurrence of Sylvio Berlusconi after the attack on the World Trade Centre.
One cannot shake off the impression that European taxpayers' money is spent on another agency to strengthen Brussels's power and to push the emergence of a euro state.
Of course, the European Parliament must be consulted on these proposals, in accordance with the Treaty, which is in line with the expectations arising from the interinstitutional agreement concluded in 2006.
But I have seen it as important that Parliament should finally be able to stand up to one side.
It has been said that the clarification of this matter depends on where the funds are available.
Sometimes we opt for the latter.

I was very honoured to take part in the debate you have expressed today on the European path that Georgia has elected.
At the same time, I would also express my regret that the proposal on geographical balance, which received majority support in the Committee on Foreign Affairs and the Committee on Budgets, and which, as I would stress, is consistent with the European Parliament's resolution of 8 July 2010, has not been sufficiently mentioned in the Rapkay report.

I look forward to an interesting dialogue with you and I think that the digital world, which is also facing so many challenges to us, the legislators, will surely keep us in power in the coming weeks and months.

The final factor in the budget is the call for information to be taken into account as national reports on the achievement of the budget objectives for the past year.
We must reflect on this!
That is why Mr Gasòliba I Böhm raised some important questions here and also found some very balanced answers with which we can go, but not enough.

The Norwegian authorities have been active in the work of the Norwegian authorities, but no solution to the protection of the wild elephant in the Tenojoki.

In truth, the Commission is pursuing this grubbing-up of 400 000 hectares - the most extensive rallies of the whole story of the wine sector in the world - since they must be made up to the 2005 Demerite Duritiin in the world, since we must first make our wine exports to the South half chamber by 2015.
I would like to highlight the following points: The increase in cofinancing to 90%, given the difficulties of NGOs and other social agencies operating in these areas, are increased to EUR 854.6 million for a seven-year period from 2007 and the change to the distribution of funds under the various programming areas.
Why?
Thirdly, the first principle in all contracts must be the reciprocal opening of the market, and it is to be noted in the current negotiations with Russia and China that, if not the problem with Russia is resolved in the area of overflight charges, China will be receiving other overflights than the European airlines, and we cannot accept that.

The results of the intervention measures in the fisheries sector can be considered satisfactory, particularly thanks to the attitude of the Committee on Fisheries, which was opposed to the Commission's initial draft right from the outset.

They have represented a large part of our community in Europe, which is not only poorly represented in elected political functions, but in many areas of public administration and public life.
All signatures must be submitted by citizens of the European Union, which are old enough to vote in the European parliamentary elections.
So this is a carefully balanced package of benefits for both parties, and I would almost say to each Member State of the European Union.
We are willing to continue this policy and we very much hope that, in line with sustainable development and respect for the environment, we can guarantee a secure and secure energy supply.
Women are very far behind men when they are paid for wages, pensions, top jobs and management positions.
The Member States have shown clearly that they want to retain parts of the extradition procedure that has been used so far.
I had asked to speak earlier, but you were thinking of solidarity at the start of today's sitting of the victims in the Sarno Valley.
Mr President, it is very important to recognise that there is an important correlation between MEDA and the new Neighbourhood Policy.
Mobility programmes should also be open to professional shemberaries, teachers and young workers.
We do not need to impose them by law.
Ladies and gentlemen, in his address to this House on 25 April, the Indian President, Abducl Kaleine, said that it is the 'honesty that is needed' to achieve a lasting solution.
These measures include the implementation of the recommendations of the Truth and Reconciliation Commission and the plan to compensate the victims of internal armed conflicts and strengthen the High Level Group (CMAN).
And the other is this: The place where, along with my colleagues and others, I try to improve this continent for the benefit of its citizens.
However, this is only an emergency solution, because in the end the consumer has to pay the bill.
In order to improve the exchange of information between the various national authorities, it is also proposed that those cases where Member States refuse to provide information or to carry out an administrative investigation should be monitored.
 (RO) Madam President, the EU's industrial policy must create an appropriate framework to increase the contribution of the EU's industry to GDP.
Mr President, I would like to thank the Commissioner for his words, which opens up the prospects for the future of relations between the European Union and Latin America.
The report also contains a section on human resources, which - without going into everything - is noted, and that the staff of the staff have increased by 23% over the last ten years.
 (LT) I would like to say that the best solution is to find additional funding because the Progress programme is practically the same as the same groups and that would mean that the efficiency is not guaranteed, if there is no additional money.
The Polish doctors are earning EUR 400 euros in the month and are being bribes to the way in which they can improve their incomes.
The patentability of software is unacceptable, because it would lead to the creation of a monopoly of large software companies at the expense of small and medium-sized enterprises that are very often playing a crucial role in the development of new technologies.
However, the industry's concerns, the expectations of the citizens of some products, could be raised too early, as well as the objection that there are sensitive data which require confidential treatment.
The conclusions of the committee report are damning.
The gods were then tired and people began to produce the laws and now the laws are incomplete.
The Commission must be critical of its attitude to a long-term attitude.
Mr President, it is worrying, as is the case throughout the world, particularly in the Indian sub-continent, the climate of violence between religions, ethnic groups and civilisations.
If this happens, the European Commission and the European Central Bank will try to prevent the flow of money from the euro area.
The competitive pressure in the common internal market and cross-border environmental aspects make a common approach.
Mr President, I welcome you and congratulate you on your address this afternoon.
We have now developed quite intense economic cooperation, Asia is, after all, the European Union's most important trading partner.
The only thing I propose is a safety framework at the highest level in all the Member States of the Union.
However, I would like to make it clear that we have an internal agenda that will be implemented, and that this agenda also includes the technological energy plan that we are going to address with the Commission, and that this first initiative is right to bring about climate change, which is indeed symbolic.
So the impact that this is about is actually very serious.
The agreements they are proposing are the inviolable rules of the World Trade Organisation, the aim of which is to make them an integral part of ultra-liberal globalisation.
At the same time, we must ensure that the freedoms granted under the Treaty are not unreasonably restricted.
We must therefore stand by our offer - 30% reduction in the CO2 gases in 2020 - in the year 2020.
There are millions of transactions.
I hope, therefore, that the European Parliament will adopt this text, which will guarantee a high level of environmental protection.
Nevertheless, I am convinced that the rights of European citizens will only be made if we build a strong political Europe based on the principle of secularism.
Madam President, as Mr Jáuregui said, the debate we are going to have now, along with the one we have just had, is extremely important.
The first is that we in Europe know how long and painful the path to freedom can be.
I would like to thank my colleagues here in the House who supported these initiatives and measures.
We have to calculate how many weeks we have to work here, because we have an incredible amount of time for work in the parliamentary committees.
The habitat has its limits, and the various maritime sectors must be responsible and ruthless.
We met yesterday evening at 10.40 p.m.
I therefore believe that we must find the right approach: Protection of forests is beneficial to the North, like the South.
It is very difficult, if not impossible, to bring together these two systems, so we must emphasise three fundamental issues.
The European information centres are doing good services where they exist, but there are too few.
If you have taken the decision, Mr Elles, that your group will be taking external assistance, that is, of course, a matter for your group.
As far as the transfer of heavy goods vehicles is concerned, I would like to say that Mr Messner's comments deserve a great deal of attention.
So, as I said, there are a great differences and we prefer to see sanctions on the administrative route away, because they are more effective and more effective.
The Structural Funds are not available for immediate emergency aid measures.
All these issues must be included in the CAP after 2013 and be taken into account in its reform.
It is not acceptable for five people to try and think about a resolution on such a sensitive and difficult issue as last night.
I would therefore call on you, ladies and gentlemen, to reject it.
The Commission is taking the ethical considerations fully into account when dealing with issues of sensitive importance, such as cloning.
What is the benchmark or the frame of reference?
Will we not have to remain silent on behalf of the common values of the Transatlantic Business Dialogue on the Iraq war or Guantanamo?
Vice-President of the Commission. - Madam President, I agree with all the speakers and all those Members who have dealt with this matter.
Subject: Croatia, Macedonia and South East Europe
In economic policy (Article 99 (5)) the procedure for cooperation - and I am looking for clarification from the Council - will replace the consultation procedure; and unanimity in Article 13 (anti-discrimination) is maintained.
The events of the last two years, such as the tragic deaths of ETA and sub-Saharan populations in the Straits of Gibraltar and the tragic killings of ETA, and the tragic killings of ETA, and the tragic killings of ETA, have once again encouraged the debate and led to speeding up the action against this dangerous and worrying landscape.
This requires us all to face constantly new challenges, which requires constant openness for new challenges by all the institutions of the European Union.
The term calorows.
At first reading, Parliament made a clear and unambiguous position on this subject, which was apparently to have objections or, if I may put it differently, the battery manufacturers have been lobbying hard.
The European Union must be focusing on the genuinely transnational aspects, namely the legal and public order of the law.
Therefore - and we will return to this - we wanted to focus on some priorities, particularly in the areas of rural development and education and culture.
In our society there are problems with research and development.
The junta has chosen a confrontation with thousands of peaceful demonstrators, which is very unfortunate, because it is a great pity that the people themselves have had the courage to oppose the courage without help from outside.
It is clear that many Member States who want to eliminate the individual opt-out - for whom you and I are - who want to do away with this possibility are being made to try to circumvent the application of this facility by the use of self-employed workers, or by multiple contracts for a worker, thereby making the whole of the work time directive possible.
However, it is particularly important for women that the relevant framework programmes for childcare are available here.
Who are we to take this right?
The Convention procedure is very interesting and efficient in drawing up a basic framework which requires a broad consensus, but it does not justify any possible amendment and amendment to the European Parliament as a representative of the people of Europe.
What action will the Commission take to speed up the Turkish military's withdrawal and what do you think it is calling for restraint to be exercised by Turkey?
We are waiting for the way in which the whole thing works.
Thirdly, and this is the question we are discussing today, the increase in oil prices is even more difficult in the sector affected by the crisis.
That is why the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs was keen to ensure that the whole package is not based on Article 121 of the Treaty, which deals with the coordination of economic policies, but also in Article 148, which deals with employment policies with a view to coordination between the Member States and the European Union.
A substantial part of these funds - this is a project of a project, if I remember correctly, about ECU 70 million - was specifically used to help the Egyptian authorities to reform the whole system of vocational training.
The results of their efforts are also hoping for long-term budgetary perspectives.
But it must also be guaranteed in the short term.
The Commission's Amendment No 1, which is one of the reasons why it must be rejected, is one of the reasons why it is not included in the EU directive.
In particular, our intention to impose restrictions on self-employed workers is in danger of becoming too much controlled and the action of the citizens of the public sector.
Mr President, thank you very much.
Mr President, I just want to devote myself to one aspect of the Myer Pleite and Yañez-Barnuevo García reports, namely their commitment to regional integration in Latin America.
And, rather than looking at it as a unique Eve, I hope that it will be another milestone for a continuous process which has been going on for a long time before the crisis - a process of cooperation between the Commission, Member States and the social partners - who is dragging its feet through this crisis and continuing after the crisis.
I am in agreement with those who say that enlargement is a unique opportunity.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I have particularly enjoyed a sentence in Mr Blak's report.
I support the Commission's proposal and believe that we should adopt it with open arms.
I wanted to know what the vote was in order to do, and what we are doing is not to justify any ambiguity after the debate and vote.
But even if - and I say this in the same way - I do not need to repeat the word - that we shall be voting against this oral amendment, we can put these amendments to the vote because this time does not make a commitment to the Commission.
The high turnout of the Kenyan voters is proof of the commitment of the people of Kenya to the democratic process and their faith in this process.
Therefore, the compulsory service service must be excluded from the European directive, and that is why the Verts / ALE Group voted in favour of Amendments 66 and 67 of this report.
What, do you believe we can achieve?
Freedom is being made to Cuba through economic commitment, but also through political isolation.
We politicians are, after all, the ones who explain this to the people of the EU and, at times, to defend it.
As the Commissioner said, the IMF, under the guidance of the G20, is currently carrying out a study on possible financial control, but it seems that this resolution is looking for responses to the aforementioned study.
Mr Parish also spoke about animal welfare.
Mr President, the current political situation in Cambodia remains a serious cause for concern.
My colleague who left the room after he had made his speech did not want to hear other viewpoints.
We must therefore prevent the healthy part of our agriculture from being stifled by bureaucracy, which is often more serious than any disease.
We are still waiting for it.
I would like to ask the President-in-Office of the Council to investigate whether the question of whether this anomaly could be put off to the Council's agenda is to be put to an early end.
The role of the European parties to the European parties has been played by the European parties.
They have been in a Member State for three years, which does not allow same-sex marriages in a Member State, but which is participating in the adoption of the regulation on the applicable law under the enhanced cooperation procedure.
This would be contrary to the effectiveness of the decision of this Parliament.
The directive has been transposed recently by the Member States and offers the right protection for the mentally handicapped people facing discrimination in the world of work.
The third challenge is that we must combat the causes of such disasters.
In writing. - In favour.
The 'no' of the Dutch Constitution makes it clear that things are going to have different things in Europe: Not less Europe, but a different Europe.
Amendment No 23 to payments for services made it confuses the obligations of consumers and providers.
We are still left in the dark about the extent to which the cost of accession will cost, and it is true that the bill is not taken into account.
President of the Court of Auditors. - Mr President, I was already outside the Chamber when this question was raised.
On the other hand, there may be disorders, indeed distortions of the internal market, in this short and medium-term analysis.
Thank you, Mr Kinnock, for this opening, which I think Mr Grosch will appreciate.
How can it be that the European Trade Union Confederation has agreed?
Madam President-in-Office, thank you for your willingness to attend this sitting, and I must say that I am one of those who believe that the Brussels Summit has been resolved to eliminate the enlargement process of enlargement and that the funding rules for agriculture were fixed for the next ten years.
The second part of your question about the balance - perhaps a question of subjective assessment.
We now come to the end of the interventions, which was given the floor without the list of speakers.
All these are essential components of a safer Europe, in the rule of law, and everyone knows that his freedom is a reality.
The proposals on the two EPAs (i.e. the David Martin and Erika Mann reports were formally announced and referred to your committee (i.e. the Committee on International Trade was only referred to at the meeting on 19 February 2009.
The subject is very important for the Europe of today, and especially for tomorrow's Europe.
I would also like to thank you for the full solidarity that you and my friends have shown to me in the years to my detention.
Everything that has happened there today has to do with events in the past, and it also depends on the shocking ignorance of the West against the complex historical reality of a particularly difficult region, and also with the uncharted and unilateralism with which he has responded largely to the Yugoslav tragedy.
This includes respect for the traditional civil liberties, particularly in the context of our current efforts to combat terrorism.
Mr President, the criminal gang of ETA is still responsible for the most obvious human rights violations within the Union.
Can the Commission explain the delay in publishing the proposal for a proposal for cross-border healthcare, given the political obligation to legislate in accordance with the ECJ judgments in this area, and the promise given when healthcare services from the Services Directive (2006 / 123 / EC) were excluded?
The uprising of the Egyptian people in favour of democratic change, defending their sovereignty against foreign intervention and the breaking of the regime with the interests of imperialism in the region is a positive sign that I hope will be reflected in practice in relation to this and other agreement.
Security, not the question of responsibility, must be the top priority.
However, the human race is facing a very serious problem, and this is a problem that could be described as the digital divide.
In this way we will protect our markets and put an end to dumping, which is often hidden through the unclear boundaries of the rule.
Allow me to start by expressing my full agreement with the outcome of the Goerens report on the need to move forward with the Development Cooperation Instrument (DCI) and its benefits to the policies of the European Union.
And I would say that all of this can be summarised in three words in today's period: Learn, learn and learn.
I believe that this is the classic law of unintended consequences.
I would like to reply to a few speeches: Mr Fleckenstein raised the SO2-problematic issue.
The local and national authorities have listened to us.
Apart from that, we do not have a specific strategy for combating AIDS.
This proposal will only be submitted to the Council by the Commission if the deadline of 90 days is up to any objections, as foreseen by the Baltic Sea.
The report advocates strongly defending the employment levels in this sector, which counts for some 90.000 vehicles and 70.000 workers in Europe.
As we know, research on embryos is prohibited in Germany and I respect this decision, and I respect this policy, which is the same research in the UK, in Spain, Belgium, France and the strict restrictions on legal or deontology.
In total, 90% of the victims of war are civilians, most of them women and children.
A high level of representative, which is not directly responsible for us in Parliament, has a duplication of functions in the Council and the Commission, a division of functions in the Council and the Commission, a separation of roles in the Council and the Commission, which occasionally ignores the EU's special envoy and the head of the Commission's heads of delegation, sometimes ignoring the human rights of economic and geopolitical interests, etc.
Can the Commission make a comprehensive statement on the latest state of affairs regarding the significant restrictions on imports of Brazilian beef into the European Union?
Another example: The Council is preparing the assessment of the human rights situation in the various countries.
It is true that we were all disappointed that this conciliation procedure was fruitless.
We are dealing with a question that concerns Portugal and you have exceeded this question by far.
In social terms, this is cynical, and politically irresponsible.
I agree with the first speech that I believe it is the basis of what I called the European Union's dialogue with non-Member States, civil society, trade unions, businesses and all interested parties; and of course the participation of the people that you mentioned, Mr Christick, is essential.
Do you share the view that the increase in the funding for Latin America and MEDA proposed in the amendments tabled by the Committee on Foreign Affairs goes against this objective and is actually going to achieve the withdrawal of funds from the budget lines for Asia?
This will cost industry costs and, in turn, will undermine the competitiveness of the European food industry.
For example, it is unclear what is going on on holidays, or on the service, and what is to be done about training.
We are very much lacking in initiatives to consolidate potential and possibly also effective growth in the European Union.
The Commission broadly agrees with Mr Maaten that the health policy and the fight against fraud and smuggling must be given more attention.
I believe that the CAP's fundamental element should still be to ensure that European agriculture remains competitive towards strong subsidised trading partners such as the United States, Japan, Switzerland and Norway, so as to provide EU farmers with fair trade conditions.
The Member States must not be allowed to use old stocks of these weapons, their consequences for health and the environment, in my opinion.
Nevertheless, in many Member States, there was a growing interest in the system.
I would like to say that there are real concerns about vaccines and antivirals.
They cannot have both!
I believe that this is the right time to address the progress made to date in the fight against international terrorism, but also to reflect on the principles on which this fight must be based.
The possibility of improving energy efficiency in housing by allocating grants from the European Regional Development Fund to 4% of the European Regional Development Fund, which is the one on the one hand, is a double one: On the one hand, the fixed energy costs of families will be reduced, and this will contribute to increased energy security and to reducing fossil fuels and greenhouse gas emissions.
The EU must agree to an increase in alcohol tax, which reduces both consumption and the damage.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I am tempted to come back to Mr Harbour's comments.
Nevertheless, the federalists who are blinded by their Utopia from another era are never in doubt!
The same applies to the concept of safe havens.
I agree with the Commission and believe that it has rightly rejected the criticism of its institution and should continue to do so, as Mr Hughes said, some officials in the DG Employment have a different opinion.
We have also seen that the Japanese industry was able to develop in the 19th and 20th centuries only thanks to public companies which were only privatised after they were actually being privatised.
How can we go on?
There is also a need to find solutions to the specific problems of organic farmers, as in Belgium, consumers' demand for organic products is far from constant and is often influenced by food crises.
I would therefore ask that the House should agree to the fact that, once again, we take this urgency on the agenda, because we will be able to do more to help the case to solve the case than we are discussing.
The conservative party's website is giving the same promise.
To achieve this, we need a single information technology programme for the whole of the Union.
You cannot always say precisely where the banalisation of the war is starting, but we all know where it can lead.
 (Applause) 
It is not necessarily a matter of tomorrow, but at least we should be able to explain what we want.
Let us be optimistic and look for better conditions for all citizens.
We believe that the seller should be able to offer compensation or replacement, and the purchaser should not be allowed to demand a price reduction or the dissolution of the Treaty.
In order to get out of the debt spiral, therefore, we must integrate the intervention instruments: This means more cooperation, more trade, more initiative towards emerging conflicts and more consistency towards corrupt and accountable governments that place the whole burden of crises and errors.
We have not managed to manage so many budget lines in our committee, so this is a particularly important policy across the board.
There were dialogues and agreements with workers, and there was translated and early retirement, all of which is being proposed for the Hogie of Charleroi, for example, as one of the first ones.
However, the reason why the supervisory authority concerned is unclear in Article 16 is not sufficiently precise.
Decentralised cooperation is focused more on the actors in the field of economic resources or on the sectoral content of cooperation.
Many people might even say that one day is perhaps an attack.
This is the style of Europe that has not been used, and it is only the Council that makes Germany.
Report (A5-0433 / 2002) by Mrs Carlotti, on behalf of the Committee on Development and Cooperation, on the Commission's communication on the 2000 annual report on humanitarian assistance (COM (2001) 307 - C5-0397 / 2001 - 2001 / 2155 (COS)) 
The sitting is suspended until voting time.
I am not surprised that the nations of Europe, which can deliver economic growth, are those who have made the necessary reforms.
Therefore, I would ask the Council not to confuse the pace with the accession of the Council.
I am pleased that Ireland has an increasing recognition of the professional role of farmers in providing good raw materials for a food sector which is obliged to meet the highest standard of consumer protection.
The Auto-Oil programme for cars has also been a reliable one.
The European Parliament has been consulted.
This fund, especially in times of crisis, can contribute to alleviate the impact of the poorest regions; it is necessary to improve the current structure of cohesion policy, so that the funds are more efficient and effective results can be achieved in a shorter time.
I know that Commissioner Patten has made a great effort over recent years to make improvements in this area, but we still have a situation where we are spending money, formally taking decisions, but they still leave something to be desired.
In the western Balkans, on the territory of the former Yugoslavia, there are still a number of unsolved problems in relations between the peoples living there.
We must also, in particular, bring the Member States to bear.
The conflict is not between Islamic and Christianity supporters, but between nomads and the swallowing land of the land, which only fails to give up.
That is very welcome.
I call on the election exams to make the votes.
The report (A5-0013 / 99) by Mrs Pack, on behalf of the Committee on Foreign Affairs, Human Rights, Common Security and Defence Policy, on the proposal for a Council regulation amending Regulation (1999) 312 - C5-0062 / 1999 - 1999 / 0132 (CNS));
Mr President, I would firstly like to congratulate the rapporteur, Mr Fayot, on the exceptional work he has done with this multi-faceted report.
I call on Parliament to correct this budgetary deadlock.
I propose retaining the same model of enlargement, which was applied during the previous enlargement.
Papayannakis report (A5-0101 / 1999) 
The Member State must compare the applicant's qualification with the qualifications required in the country, and the application must be recognised if an appropriate degree is shown.
We therefore insist on the fact that, for a number of days, tanks in this region - Turkish Kurdistan - are being sent to this region.
In particular, their stated intention to continue pursuing the introduction of kerosene taxes is very important, given the current inequality between air traffic and the other means of transport.
I made it clear that I was informed about the difficulties encountered in the soft fruit sector in the European Union.
We can also see cases of air pollution.
The results of the results fluctuate between zero and 200 billion euros, in other words the margin of uncertainty is USD 200 billion.
It has been proposed to raise this figure.
The proposal for the opening and management of duty-free quotas is in line with Article 299 (2) of the EC Treaty, which provides for specific measures to support the outermost regions.
I want to make it quite clear that I will say to this House that my colleagues and I will not be afraid to reach agreement with Parliament on this text, which is a crucial one, and which we must resolve.
I regret that the rapporteur, the PPE / EFA Group, who was also the main rapporteur against the report, is not present, because the dialogue was extremely interesting.
I have already come to the amendments that have been tabled.
Approval of the protocol on the protocol has approval of the protocol approving the approval of the protocol approving the protocol.
We cannot support this, because that would mean the denial of equal opportunities and equal treatment.
I will confine myself to highlighting a number of requirements which may also appear in the report, but which I consider to be a good thing.
This is not true, and the National Audit Office has said that the epidemic had already exceeded its high point before these measures could have been effective.
It is essential that we not only give Kosovo a new opportunity, but also take account of the unique and specific needs of Serbia.
We also believe that greater attention should be paid to the most vulnerable groups, whether they are young people, women, the elderly or the disabled.
That is very important!
During the final phase of the negotiations, an increase in the mutual trust of stakeholders was noted.
We now have more money than PAHT, but also a greater challenge, and we must therefore ensure that the intervention opportunities of the programme remain very precise.
I believe that this report has led to an excellent compromise, which I am pleased about and above all I thank you for the fruitful cooperation that we have achieved between Parliament and the Council.
The report is very sensible and balanced and will be very useful for the European Union.
Firstly, to achieve the objectives set in the Lisbon strategy, aimed at building a knowledge-based society, Member States must make clear their commitment to lifelong learning and thus contribute to creating jobs in Europe.
Why?
Does it have the form of directives or the form of regulations?
We must make an effort to make the maximum possible use of the European agri-food industry.
As you yourself said, this must be done to avoid a race for protectionism between the Member States.
We urgently need the trialogue.
The war between Chechnya and Russia is a long, inexorable and unsoluble conflict that has been going on for many years.
It also states that, in the EU, nearly 80 million poor people live.
Three years ago, both states, on the margins of a nuclear war, are at the moment of a nuclear war, and India is currently in the middle of the parliamentary elections and is a beacon of democracy and prosperity.
Once again, a good deal is not yet done.
As I said earlier, all the issues discussed at the time are linked to national responsibility.
This may be called voluntary or unvoluntary, but in a competitive labour market you must count on just one market value.
Is there any agreement on a compromise proposal that can be presented when Mr Chirac thinks that the time has come?
I congratulate you on this and look forward to it.
As regards human rights, the demand that such errors should not be repeated and that such tragedies of this nature must be obliged to prevent any such tragedies from occurring for the future.
That is why the call for a reinforced monitoring system is to be welcomed in order to ensure that the countries meet their obligations.
The same right to all employees, regardless of their sexual preference, is a major step in this direction.
I would like to say to Mr Corbett that a Member of the European Parliament has never stood by the law, even though this Rules of Procedure are not amended.
They are building up between our economies, which are a major obstacle to increasing the asymmetric shocks that destroy our cohesion.
As I assume that our Parliament should have a sense of our citizens' concerns, I would ask you to put a statement on our agenda with the following debate in order to enable us to examine the circumstances that are the underlying causes of the action that the Union has taken to ensure that the European Union is given a solidarity response.
If we really want to pursue a policy of growth which, in the case of the European Union, would probably be appropriate, then everyone must be responsible for the stability and growth pact and of monetary policy, so that the whole thing can be achieved in the end, even if its establishment and its objectives are to be reviewed.
Throughout the Union, 140 000 people lose their jobs in Finland.
Unfortunately, this is not the case.
EU legislation must apply to all workers in the EU, regardless of their country of origin.
In the context of its cross-border programmes, both Croatia and Serbia have shown willingness to cooperate in the areas on both sides of the Danube.
They only want to pay no money on the EU budget.
Furthermore, it must be ensured that the parties involved have access to information about the announcement of meetings and their results.
You have assumed political responsibility, Mr President.
It is an interim report which was put before the parties concerned and has been put into the public domain.
Mr President, when the regulation on safety features and the inclusion of biometric data in European passports were adopted in 2004, Member States are not planning any derogations from the obligation to take fingerprints.
Mr President, I am very pleased to present the recommendation and the report on the Cohesion Fund to you on behalf of the Committee on Regional Policy.
There is no doubt that, given the insufficient integration of this minority into the social and social system of the EU countries, we need an action plan to improve the situation of the Roma.
It is interesting to see this approach - and Mrs Berès is once again thanking her for her clarity and honesty - even if I do not agree with the ultimate objective - that it seeks to establish the basic principles of European Community or community living in the European Union.
Allow me to briefly address a key issue in the Objective 1 objective, which I personally am involved in.
 (FR) Mr President, the creation of European political parties was a big step towards a more democratic Europe capable of expressing its citizens' wishes.
In writing. - (NL) The report on the EU's Multiannual Financial Framework takes no account whatsoever of the frustration of the Member States, of the voters and the taxpayers throughout Europe.
It seems to me that they are in order - I will not judge them now because I do not know them fully, but there is a claim that is worrying: The loss of jobs that may be lost while farmers' incomes are maintained.
More of these concrete steps are needed to change our attitudes and prevent all forms of discrimination.
If the exercise of the right to free movement improves, it is beneficial for the citizens of the EU, since this is an intrinsic right link with citizenship of the citizenship.
As long as we take concrete measures in the European Union which are very contrary to our words and our understanding, we cannot achieve our goals more quickly.
We are opposed to any form of modulation, because this is a detrimental agricultural policy.
There is also no doubt that a solid bilateral relationship between Italy and Slovenia is in line with the eastward enlargement of the European Union and is an important factor in the gradual stabilisation of the Balkans.
Both the Council and Parliament have accepted this solution.
The mutual recognition of certification findings is also of great benefit to the Community, which is being introduced to introduce mutual recognition of certification findings in all areas of airworthiness for all Member States.
The objective will be - or may it be - all EU and national databases with applications for personal residents, biometric information and probably - in the end - - to link it to the DNA.
We adopted a directive in 1992 and we are not even now following this directive on the solvency ratio.
Many representatives of the municipalities and regions talked about how to address the serious problems that our cities are facing and about the old and new needs, workers, families and small and large production enterprises.
These consultations are essential, but nevertheless, before we make a formal decision, we will have to decide whether to proceed under the Treaty of Nice or under the Treaty of Lisbon, because we are in a kind of legal space and we have to deal with it politically and practically.
Instead, the question should be put to the question: Where was the fault?
This is often the case, and it is not always the case.
I agree with all my colleagues that these urgencies are very important.
However, a debate on the change in the pillar structure does not consider a report on the promotion of human rights and democratisation in third countries.
We believe that these objectives can be achieved thanks to the instruments already set out in the Commission's text.
We know the suffering that women suffer throughout the world, women who are raped, abused or harassed or the victims of unhealthy practices.
VAT is a general tax.
